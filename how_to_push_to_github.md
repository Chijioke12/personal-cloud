Method 1: GitHub web upload (drag & drop)

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account.
3. Choose File → Add local repository → Select the folder you unzipped.
4. Click "Publish repository" and follow prompts.

Method 3: GitHub Import (if migrating a repo)
1. From GitHub home, click "+" → Import repository.
2. Follow prompts to import from another location or upload an archive URL.
